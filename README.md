# Bacteria colony
This program is my contribution to the HackerRank contest called "Test Autoevaluación Conocimientos de Programación" created by jjaguillon.
The aim is to simulate how three diferent group of bacterias interact. The three diferent bacterias are identified by a number (0,1 and 2), and this is how they interact:
  * Type 0 bacteria: lose to Type 1 bacteria.
  * Type 1 bacteria: lose to Type 2 bacteria.
  * Type 2 bacteria: lose to Type 0 bacteria.
    
These bacterias are distributed in a toroidal ambient, that is represented using an NxN matrix. Every cell has 8 neighboring cells, if 3 or more neighbors are
